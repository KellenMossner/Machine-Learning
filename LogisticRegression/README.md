# Logistic Regression Model

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of a logistic regression model from first principles using the numpy library. The logistic regression model is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It is widely used in various domains, including machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. In this project, I have implemented the logistic regression model from scratch using the numpy library.

## Features

- Implementation of logistic regression model using numpy
- Training the model on a given dataset
- Predicting the class labels for new data points
- Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics

## Usage
1. Import the LogisticRegression class from the `logistic_regression.py` module.
2. Create an instance of the logistic regression model: `model = LogisticRegression()`
3. Train the model using labeled training data: `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`
4. Predict the class labels for new instances: `predictions = model.predict(X_test)`

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
