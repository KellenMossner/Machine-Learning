# Machine-Learning

## Overview
A repository for the collection of machine learning models and algorithms that were taught in a third year machine learning course. These models are constructed from first principles in python, using the numpy library.

## Models
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- K-Means Classifier
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- Hidden Markov Models

# Usage

To use any of these models just clone the repository and make sure that numpy and python 3.x is installed. Then import the desired model into your program.
